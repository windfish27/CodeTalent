CodeTalent
===========

User resume forms, the next should generate another page without inputs.  
But project ended.

* [skill](http://windfish27.github.io/CodeTalent/mobile/skill.html)
  - First prototype, for mobile.
* [resume-card](http://windfish27.github.io/CodeTalent/web/resume-card.html)
  - Second prototype, use [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) css framework.
  - Materialize has RWD, so first prototype useless.
  - On skill section, can add tags and use slide bar to edit percentage of skills. Inside layer is skill usage.
  - Or outside layer is usage, inside layer is skill.
